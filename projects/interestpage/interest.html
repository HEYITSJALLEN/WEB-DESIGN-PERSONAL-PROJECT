        <h2>Groot</h2>
        <p>
            Groot is a <b>Flora collosus</b>, the prophesized hero of Drez-Lar, and the accomplice of Rocket. 
            Together, the pair had traveled the galaxy picking up bounties until they met Star-Lord and Gamora just before the four of them were captured and put into the Kyln, where they also met Drax the Destroyer.
            Groot's bestfriend is Rocket.
        </p>

        <h2>Star-Lord</h2>
        <p>
            Peter Jason Quill is a <b>Celestial-Human hybrid</b> who was abducted from Earth in 1988 by the Yondu Ravager Clan and raised as one of their members, eventually building a reputation as the notorious intergalactic outlaw Star-Lord.
            He wears a suit that grants augmented strength and durability and the ability to travel through space. 
            He uses an "Element Gun", a special meta-pistol capable of projecting one of the four elements (air, earth, fire and water).
            Star-Lord shares a psychic link with his sentient space vessel, Ship.
        </p>

        <h2>Rocket</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Subject 89P13</b> is a raccoon who was genetically and cybernetically modified by High Evolutionary, giving him enhanced intelligence and the ability to speak. 
            Naming himself Rocket, he befriended fellow captive Halfworlders: Lylla, Teefs and Floor, with the four believing they would soon be allowed to live in peace on a new planet.
            He is also a skilled marksman, pilot, and planner.
