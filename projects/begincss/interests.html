        <p>
            <b>Joshiro Maruyama</b> is widely regarded as one of the top judoka in the world due to his exceptional technical mastery, mental toughness, and consistent success at the highest level.
            Known for his precise and fluid execution of traditional judo techniques, Maruyama's style is both effective and aesthetically pleasing, often described as a throwback to a more graceful form of the sport.
            His intense rivalry with fellow Japanese judoka Hifumi Abe, particularly their legendary 2020 All-Japan Judo Championships final, solidified his reputation as a resilient competitor. 
            While he narrowly missed Olympic gold, his world titles, international medals, and unwavering dedication to the principles of judo have earned him respect as one of the sport's greats.
