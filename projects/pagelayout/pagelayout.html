                <h2>Nanami's Dream of Kuantan</h2> 
                <p>
                    In Jujutsu Kaisen episode 18 season 2 (chapter 120 in the manga) where Nanami Kento from Jujutsu Kaisen dreams of Kuantan, Malaysia, it could be seen as an attempt to retreat from the battles with cursed spirits and yearn for a little peace.
                    Nanami, who is a rather serious jujutsu sorcerer, often wishes for things to be easier.
                    The city of Kuantan with its wide and sandy coasts, dense and lush jungles, and a clear sea with no massive wave, creates a precise image of comfort and quiet, something the main character finds difficult to achieve in the ongoing train of events.
                    This will reveal that the vision serves the purpose of expressing the desire of the person in question for some release from exhaustion and the duties which come with being a jujutsu sorcerer, showing Kuantan to be an exemplary situation for both it and it.

                <p>
                    Additionally, the way Kuantan showcases an awesome natural scene that suits Nanami well, given his perceptive and reflective personality.
                    There is little question that it is a paradise that he finds easily accessible to him because of the slow and easy living pace of the humans as he admires the ease and happiness with which things can be carried out of things that he sacrifices for what he considers his obligation.
                    It is no surprise that his temperament created by the tension between the normal world and his descent into the abyss of the workforce will take him to the link named Kuantan, an almost ethereal place in which it is even possible to picture embracing freedom once again, and how his life might have been were it not for remaining a jujutsu sorcerer.
