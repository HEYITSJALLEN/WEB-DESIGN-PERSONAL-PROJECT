        <p>
            One of my biggest interests is Judo. I started to learn and play judo in high school. 
            The sport was more than just physical competition; it was a mental challenge, a test of discipline, and a way to connect with a community of like-minded individuals. 
            Each practice was a chance to refine my technique, build strength, and learn valuable lessons about perseverance and respect.
            Judo taught me the importance of balance, control, and the power of a focused mind. It's a sport that has had a lasting impact on my life, and I cherish the memories I made on the mat.

            Judo also fostered a sense of humility and continuous self-improvement. 
            Every sparring session revealed new areas to develop, pushing me to face both my strengths and weaknesses. 
            Through the ups and downs, I learned that progress in Judo, much like in life, isnâ€™t always linear. 
            It requires patience, adaptability, and a deep respect for the journey itself. The lessons of perseverance and mental fortitude I gained from Judo have carried over into many other aspects of my life, helping me approach challenges with resilience and a calm, focused mindset.
