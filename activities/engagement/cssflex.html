        <h3>1. What you learned about Flex and CSS.</h3>
        <p>The Flexible Box Layout or Flexbox is a CSS model that enables the alignment of items within a single dimension which makes it a useful little toolbox to place divs inside divs. In this system it is possible to balance and build the whitespace more comfortably as opposed to traditional methods like the Float breaks.

Making content available to the largest possible audience is something users should aspire to when making a website. 
          There are reasons that are practical to do so, such as the fact that many countries have implemented laws that require web sites to meet standards (such as the ADA in the U.S.) in terms of access. There is maximum support of all major search techniques is a classic example of catering for disabled users in site planning as well.</p>
