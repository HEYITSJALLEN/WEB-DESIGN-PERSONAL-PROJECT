    <h1>Engagement - More CSS</h1>
    
    <h3>1. What is the difference between block tags and inline tags.</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Block Tags: Block elements take up the full width available and start on a new line. They typically contain other block or inline elements.</li>
        <li>Inline Tags: Inline elements only take up as much width as their content and do not start on a new line. They can be nested inside block elements and typically do not contain block elements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. What is the margin, border, and padding?</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Margin: The space outside an element's border. It creates distance between the element and other elements around it.</li>
        <li>Border: The boundary that surrounds an element. It can be styled with various widths, colors, and styles (solid, dashed, etc.).</li>
        <li>Padding: The space between an element's content and its border. It creates distance within the element itself.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3>3. What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Margin: The space outside an element's border. It creates distance between the element and other elements around it.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>px (pixels)</li>
            <li>in (inches)</li>
            <li>cm (centimeters)</li>
            <li>mm (millimeters)</li>
            <li>pt (points)</li>
            <li>pc (picas)</li>
        </ol><br>

        <li>Relative Units: These change based on other factors, such as the size of the parent element or the viewport:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>% (percent)</li>
            <li>em (relative to the font-size of the element)</li>
            <li>rem (relative to the font-size of the root element)</li>
            <li>vw (viewport width)</li>
            <li>vh (viewport height)</li>
        </ol><br>

    </ul>

    <h3>4. When would you use a figure tag?</h3>
    <p>The figure tag is used to encapsulate self-contained content, often with an optional <figcaption> for a caption or description. Itâ€™s typically used for images, illustrations, diagrams, or code snippets that need to be referenced in a way that relates directly to the content. This semantic structure improves accessibility and helps search engines understand the context of the content better.</p>
