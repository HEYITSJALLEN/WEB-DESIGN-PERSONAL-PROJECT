    <h2>When should you use a background image, and when should you use the IMG tag?</h2>

       <p>You should use a background image when the image is purely decorative, not part of the main content, and when flexible placement, such as covering an entire section, is needed. 
        Background images are useful for design purposes, allowing for easy overlay of other content, but they are not recognized by screen readers and do not impact SEO. On the other hand, you should use the <img> tag when the image is an important part of the content, contributing to the information presented on the page. The <img> tag is also necessary for accessibility, as it allows for descriptive alt text, making the image readable by screen readers. Additionally, it supports responsive design features like srcset for better adaptation to different screen sizes and is indexed by search engines, enhancing SEO.</p>
