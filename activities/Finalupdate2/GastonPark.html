        <br><p>Gaston Park is one of the most visited places here in Cagayan de Oro. It was named after a pre-war Municipal Mayor of Cagayan de Oro, Segundo Gaston, the park is located near the St. Augustine Cathedral and the Archbishopâ€™s Palace. Gaston Park was the main plaza of Cagayan de Misamis  during  the  Spanish  colonial period. It served as the training ground of local patriots during the Philippine-American War. Later it became the site of the Battle of Cagayan de Misamis on April 7, 1900. A National Historical Institute marker was placed in the park  in 2000.</p><br>
