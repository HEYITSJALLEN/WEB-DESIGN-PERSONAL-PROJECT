        <br><p>St. Augustine Metropolitan Cathedral, located in Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines, is a historical and spiritual landmark in the region. Dedicated to St. Augustine, the city's patron saint, the cathedral stands as a testament to the city's deep Catholic faith and rich heritage. Originally built in 1845, it has undergone several reconstructions due to natural disasters and wartime damage, evolving into its current modern Gothic architectural style. The cathedral is not only a place of worship but also a popular site for visitors seeking a glimpse of Cagayan de Oro's cultural and historical identity. Its serene ambiance and intricate design make it a cherished symbol of resilience and faith for locals and tourists alike.</p><br>
