    <!-- Paragraphs describing interests -->
    <p>I am Sophomore student majoring in Computer Science. My minors are Foundational Language, and Criminal Justice. My interest in coding began when I work before as a data annotator focusing in “Self-Driving Cars”.</p>

    <p>Besides programming, I enjoy cycling and exploring nature. I just discovered that going outside makes me feel free and think better. Additionally, I love playing piano, especially Sonata.</p>
