        <h3>Why don't we use the border property?</h3>
        <p>We may avoid using the border property directly on table cells to maintain a cleaner design, as it can sometimes make layouts look cluttered. Instead, other CSS properties, such as box-shadow or padding, can separate content more subtly, making designs look modern and responsive.</p>

        <h3>What is the easiest way to color every other row a different color?</h3>
        <p>The easiest way to color every other row differently is by using the nth-child pseudo-class in CSS. For example, tr:nth-child(even) { background-color: #f2f2f2; } applies a different color to every even-numbered row, creating a simple alternating row effect.</p>

        <h3>When should we use a table?</h3>
        <p>Tables should be used when displaying structured data that benefits from a grid format, like financial reports, schedules, or other comparative data. They provide a clear, organized way to present information with headers, columns, and rows, which is ideal for data that requires alignment. However, for page layout, CSS options like flexbox and grid are preferred for better responsiveness and accessibility.</p>
