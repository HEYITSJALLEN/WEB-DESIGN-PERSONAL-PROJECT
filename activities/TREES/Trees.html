        <h2>What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Block Tags: These elements take up the full width of their container, starting on a new line. They usually contain other block elements or inline elements.</li>
            <li>Inline Tags: These elements take up only as much width as necessary, and they do not start on a new line. Inline elements can be placed inside block elements but cannot contain block elements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is normal flow in HTML?</h2>
        <p>Normal flow refers to the default layout behavior of HTML elements. Block elements are stacked vertically one after the other, while inline elements flow horizontally, wrapping onto new lines when necessary. This is how elements are naturally positioned in a document before applying styles like floating or positioning.</p>

        <h2>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Float: The float property in CSS moves an element to the left or right of its container, allowing other content to wrap around it. It is typically used for images or creating multi-column layouts.</li>
            <li>Clear the Float: When an element is floated, it can affect the layout of subsequent elements, causing them to "collapse" under the floated element. The clear property is used to ensure that the next element after a floated element moves below it instead of wrapping around it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Relative Positioning: Moves an element relative to its original position. Other elements around it are not affected by this change.</li>
            <li>Absolute Positioning: Removes the element from the normal flow, positioning it relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (i.e., an ancestor element with position: relative, absolute, or fixed). Other elements will behave as if the absolutely positioned element isn't there.</li>
            <li>Fixed Positioning: Positions the element relative to the browser window, so it remains in place even when the page is scrolled. It's often used for elements like sticky headers or sidebars.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout, ensuring the buttons scale well.</li>
            <li>Style buttons with padding, border-radius (for rounded corners), and hover/active states to enhance the touch experience.</li>
            <li>Media queries can be used to adjust button size for smaller screens.</li>
            <li>Use a hamburger menu or toggle button for small screens to hide/show navigation links.</li>
        </ul>
