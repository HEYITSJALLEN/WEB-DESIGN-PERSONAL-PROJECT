    <h2>What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</h2>
    <p>JPEG is best for photos or images with a wide range of colors, gradients, and complex details—such as photographs of people, landscapes, or artwork. It’s a lossy compression format, meaning it reduces file size by discarding some data, which is not always noticeable in detailed images.</p>

    <h2>What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</h2>
    <p>GIF is ideal for simple images with solid colors, sharp edges, and limited color palettes, such as logos, icons, and animated images. GIF supports a maximum of 256 colors and is commonly used for animations due to its frame-based structure.</p>

    <h2>What is unique about the PNG format?</h2>
    <p>PNG supports lossless compression, meaning no image quality is lost during compression. It also supports transparency, allowing for the creation of images with transparent backgrounds, making it perfect for images like logos or graphics that need to overlay other content.</p>

    <h2>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h2>
    <p>To resize a photo, you can use photo editing software such as Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools. Adjust the dimensions (width and height) of the image to match the desired display size, making sure to maintain the aspect ratio to avoid distortion.</p>

    <h2>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h2>
    <p>Resizing photos using photo editing software reduces the file size, leading to faster loading times and better performance. If you use CSS to resize an image, the browser still has to load the full, original image file, which can slow down page loading and increase data usage.</p>
