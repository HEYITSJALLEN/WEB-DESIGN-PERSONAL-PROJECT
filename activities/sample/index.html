        <p>One of my biggest interests is skateboarding. I have been skating since I was a kid. Growing up with a skatepark near my house made it easy to go every day and hang out with friends and skate. I also grew up around a lot of famous skate spots and places with a lot of skate history which always inspired me to keep skating despite how difficult it is.</p>

        <p>When I was younger, I mostly skated pools and bowls. This type of skating is called <span class="highlight">transition skating</span>. My friends were always super into this type of skating, so that is what I mostly skated when I was younger. As I have gotten older, I skate less bowls and mostly skate on curbs and smaller obstacles. I have gotten a lot more scared of falling and getting hurt, but I just also have far less time to skate nowadays. I still love skating though and will always have a special place in my heart for skateboarding.</p>
