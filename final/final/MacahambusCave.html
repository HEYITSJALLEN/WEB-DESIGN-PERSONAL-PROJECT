        <br><p>Macahambus Cave, located in Cagayan de Oro City, is a historic and natural landmark of significant cultural and ecological value. This short but fascinating cave opens into a lush gorge and played a pivotal role during the Battle of Macahambus Hill in 1900. It was here that Filipino forces achieved a remarkable victory against American troops during the Philippine-American War. Today, the cave stands as a testament to this rich history while offering a haven for nature enthusiasts. Visitors can admire its unique limestone formations, explore the surrounding forest, and enjoy stunning views of the Cagayan River.
